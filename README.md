# SiSC IT Front-End Department Application

## Project Overview

This repository contains a web project that I've developed as part of my application for the IT Front-End department at SiSC (Student Union of Cybernetics at ASE Bucharest). The project serves as both a demonstration of my web development skills and a testament to my interest in contributing to the department. This project highlights my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
